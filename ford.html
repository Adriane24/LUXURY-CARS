  <h2>Ford C100</h2>
  <img src="ford/Ford-C100.jpg" alt="" style="width:304px;height:228px;"> <br><br>
  <p>The Ford C100 is a sports racing car, initially built and run as a Group 6 car, but later as a Group C car.
    The C100 was built by Ford in 1981, and initially featured a 4-litre Cosworth DFL V8 engine,
    which was replaced by a 3.3-litre version of the same engine in 1983,
    after the car had passed to private hands. Five cars are known to have been built.
    Although the cars were often very quick in qualifying (when they had been fully developed),
    reliability problems plagued them, and restricted their successes to two Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft victories in 1982,
    and a single Thundersports victory in 1983. Following the end of Ford's involvement in the C100 project in 1983,
    Zakspeed modified one of the chassis into the C1/4, which used a 1.8-litre turbocharged in-line 4 from their Group 5 Ford Capri.
    The C100 was also evolved into the Zakspeed C1/8, which used the 4-litre Cosworth DFL in a C1/4 chassis.
    The Zakspeed cars would prove to be far more successful than the C100 had ever been, and Klaus Niedzwiedz used a C1/8 to win the Interserie in 1984.</p>

    <p>The Ford Capri is a fastback coupé built by Ford Motor Company between 1968 and 1986, designed by American Philip T. Clark, who was also involved in the design of the Ford Mustang.[1] It used the mechanical components from the Mk2 Ford Cortina and was intended as the European equivalent of the Ford Mustang. The Capri went on to be a highly successful car for Ford, selling nearly 1.9 million units in its lifetime. A wide variety of engines were used in the Capri throughout its production lifespan, which included the Essex and Cologne V6 at the top of the range, whilst the Kent straight-four and Taunus V4 engines were used in lower specification models. Although the Capri was not officially replaced, the second-generation Probe was effectively its replacement after the later car's introduction to the European market in 1992.</p>

      The Ford Escort is a small family car which was manufactured by Ford Europe from 1968 to 2004. The Ford Escort name was also applied to several different small cars produced in North America by Ford between 1981 and 2003.
In 2014, Ford revived the Escort name for a car based on the second-generation Ford Focus sold on the Chinese market.</p>

    <p>
      The Ford Escort RS Cosworth is a sports derivative and the 1st 2500 were rally homologation special of the fifth generation European Ford Escort. It was designed to qualify as a Group A car for the World Rally Championship, in which it competed between 1993 and 1998. It was available as a road car from 1992–96 in very limited numbers ,the smaller turbo cars were not F.I.A recognised and only the first 2500 cars made before 1st of Jan 1993 are in fact 'Homologation special versions" It was instantly recognisable due to its large "whale tail" rear spoiler. The main selling point was the Cosworth YBT engine, a highly tunable turbocharged 2-litre engine which had an output of 230 PS (169 kW; 227 hp) in standard trim. Tuning companies have achieved power outputs of over 1,000 hp. The car was widely acknowledged to have excellent handling.
