  <p>
    The Ferrari 250 GTO is a GT car produced by Ferrari from 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA's Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. It was powered by Ferrari's Tipo 168/62 V12 engine.
    The "250" in its name denotes the displacement in cubic centimeters of each of its cylinders; "GTO" stands for "Gran Turismo Omologato", Italian for "Grand Touring Homologated."
    Just 39 250 GTOs were manufactured between 1962 and 1964. This includes 33 cars with 1962-63 bodywork (Series I), three with 1964 (Series II) bodywork similar to the Ferrari 250 LM, and three "330 GTO" specials with a larger engine. Four of the older 1962-1963 (Series I) cars were updated in 1964 with Series II bodies.

    <p>
      The Ferrari 275 is a series of two-seat front-engined V12-powered automobiles produced in GT, roadster, and spyder form by Ferrari between 1964 and 1968. The first Ferrari to be equipped with a transaxle, the 275 is powered by a 3.3 L (3286 cc) Colombo 60° V12 engine that produces 280-300 hp.
      Pininfarina designed the GT and roadster bodies, and Scaglietti the rare NART Spyder, among the most valuable of all Ferraris made. In a contemporary road test, Road and Track described it as "the most satisfying sports car in the world."
      Motor Trend Classic named the 275 GTB gran turismo/GTS roadster as number three in their list of the ten "Greatest Ferraris of all time".
      The 275 GTB/4 debuted in 1966. A much updated 275 GTB, the four overhead camshaft, six 2-barrel carbuerated 275 GTB/4 was named number seven on Sports Car International's 2004 list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s.
