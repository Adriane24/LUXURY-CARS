  <h2>2018 Lexus ES</h2>

  <p>
The Lexus ES is a series of compact, then mid-size, and later executive car sold by Lexus since 1989. Six generations of the sedan have been introduced to date, each offering V6 engines and the front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. The first five generations of the ES were built on the Toyota Camry platform, with the sixth generation more closely related to the Avalon. Manual transmissions were offered until 1993, a lower-displacement inline-four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010, and a gasoline-electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012. The ES was Lexus' only front-wheel drive vehicle until 1998, when the related Lexus RX was introduced, and the sedan occupied the entry-level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the Lexus IS in 1999. The ES name stands for "Executive Sedan". However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, "Elegant Sedan".

    <p>
      The Lexus LC is a grand tourer/personal luxury car from Lexus, Toyota's luxury division. It is based on the 2012 LF-LC Concept, designed by Toyota Calty Design Research in Newport Beach, California. It was developed under the program codename "950A" from 2011 to 2016, design work was transferred from Calty to Toyota Technical Centre in Aichi, Japan from January 2013, with a final production design freeze in the first half of 2014.

    <h2>2018 Lexus LS</h2>
    <img src="lexus/2018lexusLs.jpg" alt="" style="width:354px;height:238px;"><br><br>
    <p>
      The Lexus LS is a full-size luxury car (F-segment in Europe) serving as the flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive, with Lexus also offering all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option.
  As the first model developed by Lexus, the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994. The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460/LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as Toyota Celsior, was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year) the fourth-generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system.

    <h2>2018 Lexus RX 350L</h2>

    <p>
      The Lexus RX is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV sold since 1998 by Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. Originally released in its home market of Japan in late 1997 as the Toyota Harrier, export sales began in March 1998 as the Lexus RX.Four generations of the Lexus RX have been produced to date, the first being compact in size, and the latter three classified as mid-size. Both front- and four-wheel drive configurations have been used on the RX series, and several gasoline powertrain options, including V6 engines and hybrid systems, have been offered. In the Lexus model lineup, the RX sits below the larger GX and LX body-on-frame SUVs, and above the smaller NX crossover. The RX name stands for Radiant Crossover. It has also been labelled as "Recreation Cross Country" in some markets.
      The first-generation RX 300, fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 engine, began sales in 1998. The Japanese market Toyota Harrier released in 1997 also offered a 2.2-liter inline-four, later uprated to 2.4-liters.

      <h2>2018 Lexus UX</h2>
      <img src="lexus/2018lexusUx.jpg" alt="" style="width:354px;height:238px"> <br><br>
      <p>
      The Lexus crossover lineup will gain a new entry-level model called the UX, as previewed by the wild-looking UX concept introduced last fall and shown here. The official word comes from Lexus International executive vice president Yoshihiro Sawa, who spoke to the Australian publication Motoring at the Geneva auto show last week. The wee UX will slot in below the NX, giving Lexus a more right-sized and right-priced competitor to the likes of the BMW X1, the Mercedes-Benz GLA-class, and the Audi Q3.As it stands now, the 182.3-inch-long Lexus NX is a bit larger and more expensive than those diminutive luxo-utes. The 173.2-inch-long UX concept aligns closely size-wise with the Germans and should cost a few thousand dollars less than the NX, which starts at $36,260. The UX concept’s basic dimensions aren’t likely to change much in its transition to production car, but its extreme sci-fi styling may—even if Lexus’s spindle grille sticks around.
